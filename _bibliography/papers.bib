  abstract = {Assuming standard conjectures, we show that the canonical symmetrizing trace on the Hecke algebra of irreducible spetsial complex reflection groups produces rational Catalan numbers when evaluated at powers of a Coxeter element. This extends a technique used by Galashin, Lam, Trinh, and Williams to uniformly prove the enumeration of their noncrossing Catalan objects for finite Coxeter groups.}

  abstract={We construct a bijection between certain Deodhar components of a braid variety constructed from an affine Kac-Moody group of type {$A_{nâˆ’1}$} and vertex-labeled trees on {$n$} vertices. By an argument of Galashin, Lam, and Williams using Opdam's trace formula in the affine Hecke algebra and an identity due to Haglund, we obtain an elaborate new proof for the enumeration of the number of vertex-labeled trees on {$n$} vertices.},
