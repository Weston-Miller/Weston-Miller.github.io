I am a first year PhD student in mathematics at the University of California, San Diego.

Research interests: I am mostly interested in the intersections of algebra with other subjects (algebraic combinatorics, algebraic geometry, algebraic topology).

When I'm not doing math, I enjoy [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109451240-weston), cooking, playing [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/atropos7), and playing piano.
